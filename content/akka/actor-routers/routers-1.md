## Routers

> A router is a special type of actor whose job is to route messages to other actors called routees. Different routers use different strategies to route messages efficiently. Routers can be used inside or outside of an actor, and you can manage the routees yourself or use a self contained router actor with configuration capabilities, and can also **resize dynamically under load**.
