## HOCON

### Human-Optimized Config Object Notation

- less noisy / less pedantic syntax
- ability to refer to another part of the configuration (set a value to another value)
- import/include another configuration file into the current file
- a mapping to a flat properties list such as Java's system properties
- ability to get values from environment variables
- ability to write comments
