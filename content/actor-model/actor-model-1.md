## Actor Model

> The actor model in computer science is a mathematical model of concurrent computation that treats "actors" as the universal primitives of concurrent computation. In response to a message that it receives, **an actor can: make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages, and determine how to respond to the next message received**. Actors may modify private state, but can only affect each other through messages (avoiding the need for any locks).
