## Actor Model - fundamental concepts

The Actor model adopts the philosophy that **everything is an actor**. This is similar to the everything is an object philosophy used by some object-oriented programming languages. 

An actor is a computational entity that can concurrently:
- send a finite number of messages to other actors
- create a finite number of new actors
- designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives
